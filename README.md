>> <h3> About the project </h3>

<p> This project is an exclusive request of the human resources sector of my company and aims, above all, to
automate the process of exporting excel sheets to <b>Trello</b> </p>

<b>Trello</b> is a framework-based project management platform,
that allows users to organize tasks, manage projects and work
with teams in a visual and intuitive way. <b>Trello</b> is a highly
flexible that can be used to manage projects from small to large,
from personal tasks to complex business projects.

>> <h3> How to Run </h3>

<p> Before running any script, make sure you have installed the necessary libraries
located in the "pips" folder. </p>

<p> That said, the project starts with the "init.py" script that will ask you for some parameters:
Keyacess, TokenAcess, Path+Excel_Name, and name of the worksheet you want to automate.
Once this is done, he will create a workspace in <b>Trello</b>, inserting the lists, cards and also the custom fields.
In the end, you will be able to use <b>Trello</b> normally. </p>

<i>Detail: For custom fields to work, you need to be a premium Trello member</i>.
